COVID-19, Take one minute and read. Be understanding !!! A Japanese doctor offers excellent advise on preventing COVID-19. New coronavirus may not show symptoms for several days (14-27 days). How can one know if the person is infected? By the time he has a fever and/ or a cough and goes to the lung hospital, the patient may have 50% fibrosis, and then it is too late. Taiwanese experts provide simple self-monitoring that we can do every morning: Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you can do this successfully without coughing and without difficulty, without anxiety or chest tightness, it shows you do not have fibrosis and generally indicate no infection..	fake

Berries, apples, cucumbers and tomatoes are the worst because some people eat the skin. This explains why the virus is spreading faster in the west than asia.

"Mask wearers beware. A caller to a radio talk show recently shared that his wife was hospitalized and told she had COVID and only a couple of days left to live. A doctor friend suggested she be tested for legionnaires disease because she wore the same mask every day all day long. Turns out it WAS legionnaires disease from the moisture and bacteria in her mask. She was given antibiotics and within two days was better. WHAT IF these ""spikes"" in COVID are really something else due to mask-wearing?? Copied and pasted - and checked - it's true!"	fake
